!2 RADIUS Communication - Script Mode
This mode is useful for request definition when request contains several attributes.

ATTENTION: differently from Accounting and Authentication script requests, sent via methods ''send accounting'' and ''send authentication'', when a generic packet is sent (via the ''send packet'' method) the packet type should be explicitly defined (via the ''set packet type'' method) like in the following example.

|...            |...                        |
|set packet type|12345                      |
|check          |send packet|Unknown (12345)|
|...            |...                        |
