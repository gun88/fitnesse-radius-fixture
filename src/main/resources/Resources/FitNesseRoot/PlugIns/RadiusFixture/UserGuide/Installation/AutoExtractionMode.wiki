!1 !-Auto Extraction Mode Installation-!
If you do not want to use !-RadiusFixture-! as a plugin, the auto extraction utility can be executed running the following command (replacing /path/to/fitnesse-radius-fixture.jar with the actual fitnesse-radius-fixture.jar and !-/FitNesseRoot/path-! with actual !-FitNesseRoot-! path):

{{{java -classpath /path/to/fitnesse-radius-fixture.jar com.github.gun88.fitnesse.plugin.radius.RadiusClientPlugin /FitNesseRoot/path}}}

!2 Documentation
Documentation files are extracted in the [[!-FitNesse PlugIns-!][<PlugIns]] directory.

!2 Dependencies
!-RadiusFixture-! needs the [[tinyRadius][http://www.jcraft.com/tinyRadius/]] library that, in plugin mode, is also auto-extracted.

!2 Classpath
During extraction, paths to required jars are replaced in the !-RadiusFixture.wiki-! so the user guide file can be executed correctly. To run :
 1 tinyRadius.jar.path
 1 radiusFixture.jar.path

!2 Create Test
If auto extraction mode was used as installation method, to create your test using !-RadiusFixture-!, you need to define paths to required jars in your test/suite page :
{{{!-!path /actual/path/to/tinyRadius.jar
!path /actual/path/to/radiusFixture.jar-!}}}
NOTE: differently from plugin mode, paths must be defined due to the fact that these are not stored in FitNesse context.
More details on test creation available [[here][<UserGuide.RadiusTestCreation.CreateYourFirstTest]].
