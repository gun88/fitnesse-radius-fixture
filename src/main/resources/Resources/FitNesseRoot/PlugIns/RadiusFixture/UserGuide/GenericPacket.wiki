!2 RADIUS Generic Communication
Here is explained how to send RADIUS Generic packet. Two modes are available: ''Script Mode'' and ''Table Mode''.
RADIUS Acceptance test (in both Table and Script mode) can be improved using ''Scenario Tables''.

In most cases, examples/tests are built around a custom packetType (254), supported by the RADIUS Server Mock. This is a simple echo service.
